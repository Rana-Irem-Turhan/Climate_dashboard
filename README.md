The Climate Dashboard presents interactive visualizations of human-induced COâ‚‚ emissions, land and land-ocean temperature anomalies, and sea level rise over the past 30 years. Developed as part of a bachelor's thesis at Riga Technical University, the tool supports climate education by combining storytelling, animations, and multi-variable trend exploration.
